This is the backend for a calendar app using Spring Boot with Repos,Services,Controllers and Entities. 
It also has a security class to make testing a bit easier and a CommandLineRunner to setup tests.

Currently its not connected to a frontend or not fully finished as its only a Public View demo branch.
